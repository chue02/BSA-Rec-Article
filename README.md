# How Much Do Top Receivers Contribute to QBâ€™s Stats?

This project analyzes the numbers from the top QBs in the NFL in relation to the stats with their top receiving target by isolating the QB's numbers from the numbers from their top receiving target.

For instance, regarding the 2023 season how many yards does Dak Prescott lose after you subtract the yards CeeDee Lamb accumulated throughout the year? Will Dak lose more yards than the average quarterback's yardage discount? How many more yards does Dak lose than Patrick Mahomes when one discounts Travis Kelce's numbers from Mahomes?

The results from this project helps answers the questions such as the ones in these examples.
